# Research Questions:

### The research questions for the project are the following:
- Which state has the most covid cases for the year 2021 and 2022?

- Which state has the most deaths caused by covid for the year 2021 and 2022?

- Which state has the highest average student count for hybrid, remote and in-person learning
  modality for the year 2021 and 2022?

# Conclusion:

- Decision Tree model has the highest accuracy but still very low.

- One of the reason might be that there are not enough features in the dataset.

- Also, there is not enough data to predict correct accuracy.

- Since the dataset is thoroughly cleaned, so noise might not be the cause of low accuracy.
